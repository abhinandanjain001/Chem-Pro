## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Set Environment Variable

After deployment, your site won't work yet! You need to add the API key:

2. Go to **"Environment variables"** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"Add a variable"**
4. Enter:
   ```
   Key:   VITE_API_KEY
   Value: AIzaSyYOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
   ```
5. Click **"Save"**

### **Step 6: Redeploy**

1. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"**
3. Select **"Deploy site"**
4. Wait 30 seconds

---

## 🎉 Your Site is Live!

You'll get a URL like:
```
https://random-name-123.netlify.app
```

### **Test It:**
1. Open the URL
2. Go to Quiz tab
3. Generate a quiz
4. ✅ Should work!
5. Get roasted! 🔥

## 🎨 Optional: Change Site Name

2. Click **"Change site name"**
3. Enter: `chemgenius` (or your choice)

cd C:\Users\rashm\Downloads\chemi\chemimind_extracted
